# qhack-project-raflaneq
Repo for your official project submission ot the QHACK '23 hackathon.

Our aim is to reproduce the results from the paper by **'Quantum-Enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo'** by *David Layden* et al [on *arxiv*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12497). Which we belive fits under the **Quantum Computing Today** challenge. Firstly our aim is to reproduce the results directly from a real quantum device, following which we would like to advance by introducing hardware efficient modifications to the algorithm and obtain plausible enhancements than the former.

To this end we will be extensively using the python project [**quMCMC**](https://github.com/pafloxy/quMCMC) which was partly authored by one of our team members previously. This project provides simulation based implementation of the algorithm mentioned and some tests for the same.
