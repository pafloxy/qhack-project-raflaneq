    "Our aim in this project is to explore the idea of an **Quantum Enhanced** MCMC algorithm, which was proposed initially by *David Layden et al* in the this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12497). Markov Chain Monte-Carlo is one of the fundamental tools available for a sampling tasks that arises in wide variety of computational problems. One specific area of interest is sampling from thermal distribution of Spin-Glass type hamiltonians at low tempeatures, where the energy landscape turns into a space of sparse energy minimas separated by wide barren plateaus making it difficult for usual algorithms to sample effectively.\n",

    "The usual approach to this task is through the **Metropolis Algorithm**, which essentially consisits of two steps :\n",
    "1. **Proposal Step :**  We propose a transition from the current state *s* to another state *s'*, with some probability $\\mathbf{Q}(s \\rightarrow s')$\n",
    "2. **Acceptance Step :** Based on the sampling inverse-temperature $\\beta$, we accept or reject the proposed transition with the probability $\\mathbf{T}(s \\rightarrow s') = min(1, \\frac{\\mathbf{Q}(s \\rightarrow s')}{\\mathbf{Q}(s' \\rightarrow s)}e^{-\\beta (\\mathbf{E}(s') - \\mathbf{E}(s))})$\n",

    "The expectation is that with sufficient iteration of the above algorithm i.e an MCMC chain of the accepted states ($ s_0 \\rightarrow s_1 \\rightarrow s_2 \\rightarrow s_3$ . .. ) we can closely approximate the desired probability distribution $\\mathbf{P}(s) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathbf{E}(s)}}{\\mathcal{Z}_{\\beta}}$. However one significant caveat in this approach is that under a general setting we lack a good *'proposal mechanism'* that can effciently propose transitions which would be accepted with high enough probability and this considerably slows down the convergence of the MCMC chain to the desired distribution. Basic classical approcahes like the *uniform-sampling* where we pick randomly pick a state at uniform or *local-sampling* where we propose local changes often fail to sample the space effectively because either the states proposed have high energy difference or are too localised to the intial state. \n",

Physically it could be thought analogous to *'quantum-mechanical-tunneliing'*, where particles can tunnel through narrow regions of high-energy barriers. In the next section we highlight the basic step of this enhanced proposition algorithm (refer as quMCMC)                                       \n",

    "The approach to built a quantum algorithm that can help us with better propositions can be designed based on your intuition of the available QAOA type algorithms where we stack layers of alternating operators applying the *Phase* and the *Mixer* Unitaries. There the role of the phase unitaries $\\hat{U_p}$ is to apply phases corresponding the problem hamiltonian $\\hat{H_p}$ and mixer unitary $\\hat{U_m}$ acts to mix-up the phases of different basis states such as to allow transitions between them, the usual choice for being $ \\hat{H}_m = \\sum_i \\hat{X}_i$ since it easier to implemnt on device and also does not commute with the $\\hat{H}_p$. though for this algorithm we won't need to optimse the angles corresponding to this unitaries like the QAOA we use the same essential ingredeints.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here $\\gamma$ introduced a relative weight between the two hamiltonians and $\\alpha$ is introduced to balance the overall strength between the two hamiltonians . The basic idea to enhancing the proposal mechanism here is to, start with a random state *s* and evolve it under the $\\hat{U}_{ev} = e^{-i \\tau \\hat{H}_{ev}}$ for a short period of time and then measure it in a computational basis to get the proposed state *s'*. Then *s'* is either accepted or rejected into the mcmc chain based on $\\mathbf{T}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the proposal probability we have $\\mathbf{Q}(s \\rightarrow s') = |\\bra{s'}\\hat{U}_{ev}\\ket{s}|$, and since we know from the rules of unitary evolution that $|\\bra{s}\\hat{U}_{ev}\\ket{s'}| = |\\bra{s'}\\hat{U}_{ev}\\ket{s}|$, our assumption $\\mathbf{Q}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathbf{Q}(s' \\rightarrow s)$ remains true.\n",

    "It should be noted that only the *proposition step* in our algorithm reqruies a quantum resources, while the *acceptance step* can be run classically. This is of the same flavour as conventional *Hybrid Algorithms* but with the strict difference that id doesn't involve any parameter tuning or gradient calculation. However, it is evident that to effectively use this algorithm one would need quantum devices that could be operated *dynamically* i.e to be able to measure and reinitiate them online. And since most available devices lack this feature we cannot directly implement this algorith as is on a real quantum device, this issue will be adressed in a later section. \n"

The plot shows the statistics of all the values, intuitively we expect a better performing algorithm to have most transitions accepted and thus the ditribution concentraed around zero.\n"
